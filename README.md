# RAFD Face Classifer #

This repository contains a resnet-18 based face classifier. It can be used to train/test RAFD dataset. 
I implemented this to evalute the classification error of multi-domain translation GAN's ouputs. If you find this useful, you are welcome to use. 
I have uploaded the model's weight (near-perfect acc on validation set of RaFD, $99.59 %$)
